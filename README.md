# 🧱 Jenga: The Data Science Workflow

> _From raw ideas to real-world solutions._  
> This repository is built on a clear, iterative and purposeful data science framework.

---

## 🚩 1. Business Understanding

**Objective:** Identify the problem, define the goals, and align outcomes with stakeholder expectations.

- Understand the context and constraints.
- Ask critical questions:  
  `What’s the problem? Why now? What decision will this project support?`
- Define success criteria and impact expectations.

> 📎 _"No analysis should begin without purpose. Business understanding comes first."_

---

## 🗂️ 2. Data Acquisition & Preparation

**Objective:** Gather, inspect, and clean data to prepare it for analysis.

- Collect data from files, APIs, databases, or web scraping.
- Assess formats, types, completeness, and consistency.
- Clean, transform, and shape datasets:
  - Handle missing values
  - Remove duplicates
  - Create or engineer new features
  - Merge or join multiple data sources

> 💡 _Maintain an untouched backup of the raw dataset (`df_original`) at all times._

---

## 🔍 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**Objective:** Reveal patterns, relationships, and outliers that influence modelling.

- Generate statistical summaries.
- Visualise relationships using:
  - Bar charts
  - Box plots
  - Histograms
  - Correlation heatmaps
- Form initial hypotheses.

> 🎯 _This is where the data begins to speak._

---

## 🧠 4. Modelling

**Objective:** Build predictive or descriptive models using suitable algorithms.

- Select the right model type:
  - Classification / Regression / Clustering
- Train using clean, well-prepared datasets.
- Validate using metrics such as:
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC
- Perform cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.

> ⚖️ _The goal is not complexity—but clarity, performance, and explainability._

---

## 📈 5. Evaluation

**Objective:** Ensure that the model is effective, relevant, and interpretable in real-world terms.

- Compare performance across different models.
- Evaluate in the context of original goals.
- Acknowledge limitations and ethical concerns.
- Provide interpretability and insights for end-users.

> 📎 _Does the solution actually solve the initial problem?_

---

## 🗣️ 6. Communication & Delivery

**Objective:** Translate data outputs into impactful, actionable narratives.

- Build dashboards or visual reports.
- Tailor the presentation for decision-makers.
- Deliver clear, simple takeaways.

**Tools:** `Streamlit`, `Power BI`, `Tableau`, `Excel`, `Canva`

> 💬 _"Stakeholders don’t want models. They want meaning."_  

---

## ♻️ 7. Iteration & Monitoring

**Objective:** Ensure continuous value delivery beyond initial deployment.

- Integrate feedback loops.
- Monitor live model performance.
- Plan for updates, retraining, or hand-off to production environments.

> 🔁 _Data science doesn’t end at deployment—it evolves._
